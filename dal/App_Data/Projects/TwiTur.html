<h4 class=\"title grey\">Implementation & Technologies</h4>
<p>
    <span class="bold">Single page application:</span>
    The html is loaded on the client side (web browser) only once when application initialized, after that all user interfaces
    are generated by the client itself. Client application build upon <a href="#">Ural SPA Framework</a> on <a href="#">coffee-script</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="bold">Pros:</span>
    Agile user interface, no page reloading needed. Reduction in size of the data passed from server to client (only raw data, not HTML). 
        Since this is a browser application, it could work on any device: mobile phones, tablets, all desktop systems and because of the agile user interface it could be felt like native application created specially for device where it launched.
</p>
    <p>    
        <span class="bold">Cons:</span>
    The interface itself could work only in modern browsers, the client machines also need to be not too obsolete.<br />
</p>
<h4 class="title grey">Data Service</h4>
<p>
    Data service is implemented using <a href="#"> OData service protocol </a>. OData protocol allow works with data in RESTFUL way, provide any client the ability to consume service interfaces in easy way.
    The protocol well definition and documentation guarantee that developers won't have problems with learning and understanding how to access service data.
</p>
<h4 class="title grey">Data Layer</h4>
<p>
    Data stored in <a href="#"> Mongo database </a>. Among its features: no data schemes (reduction in development time), low cost of storage, intuitive admin interface (all java script). The minuses are: 
    consume large disk space to store data (in general space of the disk available should be 2x more than the data stored), indexing should be done in "right" way, large amount of RAM memory needed to operate with large volumes of data,
    though these drawbacks could be applied to any modern data base.
