                        <p class="font-align-left">
                            We have the strict rules to control execution of the project and our project managers is alway connected to hear any problems which may occur. We use JIRA as your primary issue and task tracking system, all our customers have own account in our private JIRA server where they can control project execution and communicate with all concerned members of our team.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All sources of our projects are hosted on Gihub or Bitbucket with git as a primary source control system, this mean you have access to your source code and all changes has been made immediately after project is over, also it allows us to communicate with your development team (if you had one) with no problems, fix bugs and implement new features in agile way - you will get all changes immediately after they would be done.

                            At the start of the project we set 3 major milestones
                        </span>

                        </ul>
                        <p class="font-align-left">
                            At the planning stage your team manager documents all tasks which should be implemented, assign team members, fix milestones for implementation stage and indeed appoint release date for the project. This stage is usually takes 1-3 days, of cause it could take longer for bigger projects.This stage assumes that your representative, responsible for the project be ready to cooperate with us intensively.
At the end of this stage we offer formal contract for the deal where terms, conditions and prices are defined.
                        </p>
                        <p class="font-align-left">
                            At the implementation stage our assigned team is worked on the project, you could communicate with all members of the team, but usually to avoid unnecessary discoordination all communications are piped through the project manager. We suggest to use JIRA as primary tracking and communication system.
                        </p>
                        <p class="font-align-left">
                            At the end of this stage we expect to fulfill all your tasks for implementation of the project, but this happens only after you full satisfaction the job we done, this mean you see the complete result, test and accept it.
                        </p>
                        <p class="font-align-left">
                            After you accept the job, you transfer money for us and we transfer for you source code (usually this mean that we make you owner of source control repository)
                        </p>
                        <p class="font-align-left">
                            Staging stage - this stage is complimentary and we introduce this to guarantee high quality of our job, after end of the project we take obligations to fix all bugs which could be found in the code we had implemented.
We guarantee this service for 3 month after project actually have been completed.
